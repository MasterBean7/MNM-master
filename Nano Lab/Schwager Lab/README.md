# ploting and evaluation/calculations of lab class nano @ Prof. Schwager "Absorption of semiconducting polymers"
These scripts simplify the evaluation of the data provided by Schwager.

Please bring your data into the .csv files form (take a look in the example data) or adapt the code to your data structure.

## plot_mono.R

Creates a plot of absroation vs wavelenght of monomer. with auto determination maximum peak and FWHM.
NOTE: the measuerment data file was converted to a .csv file.

## plot_poly.R

Creates a plot of absroation vs wavelenght of polymer. with auto determination maximum peak and FWHM.
NOTE: the measuerment data file was converted to a .csv file.

## calc_absorbance_integral_monomer.R

Creates a plot of absorbance vs frequency of monomer. with auto surface area estimation under the maximum peak.
NOTE: the measuerment data file was converted to a .csv file.

## calc_absorbance_integral_polymer.R

Creates a plot of absorbance vs frequency of polymer. with auto surface area estimation under the maximum peak.
NOTE: the measuerment data file was converted to a .csv file.

## plot_transition_probabilities.R

Calculates and plot the transition porbabilites in respect to the conjugated bonds.

## measuerment data

sample data already in the form in which the program would expect it.
